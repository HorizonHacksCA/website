							<h2>The Theme</h2>
							<hr>
							<p>For <b class="goofy">HorizonHacks 2024</b>, our theme will be studying. Participants will create a program to assist students in their studying. Key problems surrounding this topic may include procrastination, burnout, and information retention. In the name of fairness, a detailed case will be revealed on the first day so no team has an advantage.</p>

								<h3>Conceptual</h3>
								<hr>
								<p>In the conceptual category, teams will be instructed to come up with a concept and an execution for a solution. This may look like making a slideshow consisting of their idea and how their idea will work. No working product for this category will be required and recommended for inexperienced teams who want to meet new people. All teams are welcome to attend the conceptual category.</p>
								<h4>Judging:</h4>
								<ul>
									<li>Concept: 50%</li>

								</ul>
							</div>

								<h3>Practical</h3>
								<hr>
								<p>The practical category will have teams put together actual working demos of their ideas in addition to giving presentations explaining to our panel of judges what their demos do. This category is recommended for advanced teams with experience in hackathons. All teams are welcome to attend the practical category.</p>
								<h4>Judging:</h4>
								<ul>
									<li>Concept: 25%</li>
